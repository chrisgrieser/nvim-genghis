## How is this different from `vim.eunuch`?
- Various improvements like automatically keeping the extensions when no extension is given, or moving files to the trash instead of removing them.
- Uses only vim-commands or lua os-modules, so it has no dependencies and works cross-platform.
- Makes use of up-to-date nvim features like `vim.ui.input` or `vim.notify`. This means you can get nicer input fields with normal mode support via plugins like [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim), and confirmation notices with plugins like [nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify), if they are installed and setup.
- If used with dressing and cmp, [you can also get autocompletion of directories](#autocompletion-of-directories).
- Written 100% in lua. 

## Installation and Setup

```lua
-- Packer
use {"chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis", requires = "stevearc/dressing.nvim"}

-- Lazy
{"chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis", dependencies = "stevearc/dressing.nvim"},
```

`nvim-genghis` (and `dressing.nvim`) require no `.setup()` function. Just create keybindings for the commands you want to use:

```lua
local keymap = vim.keymap.set
local genghis = require("genghis")
keymap("n", "<leader>yp", genghis.copyFilepath)
keymap("n", "<leader>yn", genghis.copyFilename)
keymap("n", "<leader>cx", genghis.chmodx)
keymap("n", "<leader>rf", genghis.renameFile)
keymap("n", "<leader>mf", genghis.moveAndRenameFile)
keymap("n", "<leader>nf", genghis.createNewFile)
keymap("n", "<leader>yf", genghis.duplicateFile)
keymap("n", "<leader>df", function () genghis.trashFile{trashLocation = "your/path"} end) -- default: "$HOME/.Trash".
keymap("x", "<leader>x", genghis.moveSelectionToNewFile)
```

## Available Commands

### File Operation Command
- `.createNewFile` or `:New`: Create a new file.
- `.duplicateFile` or `:Duplicate`: Duplicate the current file.
- `.moveSelectionToNewFile` or `:NewFromSelection`: Prompts for a new file name and moves the current selection to that new file. (Note that this is a Visual Line Mode command; the selection is moved linewise.)
- `.renameFile` or `:Rename`: Rename the current file.
- `.moveAndRenameFile` or `:Move`: Move and Rename the current file. Works like the UNIX `mv` command. Best used with [autocompletion of directories](#autocompletion-of-directories).

The following applies to all commands above: 
- If no extension has been provided, uses the extension of the original file.
- If the new file name includes a `/`, the new file is placed in the respective subdirectory, creating any non-existing folders. Except for `.moveAndRenameFile`, all operations take only place in the current working directory, so `.moveAndRenameFile` is the only command that can move to a parent directory.
- All commands support [autocompletion of existing directories](#autocompletion-of-directories).

`renameFile` and `moveAndRenameFile` will notify any running LSP client about the renaming. LSP servers supporting the `workspace/willRenameFiles` method can use this information to update various code parts, for example `use` or `import` statements.

### File Utility Commands
- `.trashFile{trashLocation = "/your/path/"}` or `:Trash`: Move the current file to the trash location. [Defaults to the operating-system-specific trash directory.](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis/blob/main/lua/genghis.lua#L164) ⚠️ Any existing file in the trash location with the same name is overwritten, making that file irretrievable. If [bufdelete.nvim](https://github.com/famiu/bufdelete.nvim) is available, `require'bufdelete.nvim'.bufwipeout` would be used to keep window layout intact instead of `vim.cmd.bwipeout`.
- `.copyFilename` or `:CopyFilename`: Copy the file name. When `clipboard="unnamed[plus]"` has been set, copies to the `+` register, otherwise to `"`.
- `.copyFilepath` or `:CopyFilepath`: Copy the absolute file path. When `clipboard="unnamed[plus]"` has been set, copies to the `+` register, otherwise to `"`.
- `.copyRelativePath` or `:CopyRelativePath`: Copy the relative file path. When `clipboard="unnamed[plus]"` has been set, copies to the `+` register, otherwise to `"`.
- `.copyDirectoryPath` or `:CopyDirectoryPath`: Copy the absolute directory path. When `clipboard="unnamed[plus]"` has been set, copies to the `+` register, otherwise to `"`.
- `.copyRelativeDirectoryPath` or `:CopyRelativeDirectoryPath`: Copy the relative directory path. When `clipboard="unnamed[plus]"` has been set, copies to the `+` register, otherwise to `"`.
- `.chmodx` or `:Chmodx`: Makes current file executable. Equivalent to `chmod +x`.

To always use system clipboard put this in your configuration file:
```lua
-- lua
vim.g.genghis_use_systemclipboard = true
```

```vim
-- viml
let g:genghis_use_systemclipboard = v:true
```

### Disable Ex-Commands
Put this in your configuration file:

```lua
-- lua
vim.g.genghis_disable_commands = true
```

```vim
-- viml
let g:genghis_disable_commands = v:true
```

## Autocompletion of directories
You can get autocompletion for directories by using `dressing.nvim`, `nvim-cmp`, and vim's omnifunc:

```lua
-- packer
use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis", requires = {
		"stevearc/dressing.nvim",
		"hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
		"hrsh7th/cmp-omni",
	},
}
-- lazy
{ "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis", dependencies = {
		"stevearc/dressing.nvim",
		"hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
		"hrsh7th/cmp-omni",
	},
},
```

```lua
-- required setup for cmp, somewhere after your main cmp-config
require("cmp").setup.filetype("DressingInput", {
	sources = cmp.config.sources { {name = "omni"} },
})
```

## Why that name
A nod to [vim.eunuch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch) - as opposed to childless eunuchs, it is said that Genghis Khan [has fathered thousands of children](https://allthatsinteresting.com/genghis-khan-children).
