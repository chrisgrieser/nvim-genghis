Lightweight and quick file operations without being a full-blown file manager.
For when you prefer a fuzzy finder over a file tree, but still want some
convenient file operations inside nvim.

## Features
**Commands**
- Perform **common file operations**: moving, renaming, creating, deleting, or
  duplicating files.
- **Copy** the path or name of the current file in various formats.
- **Navigate** to the next or previous file in the current folder.
- **Lightweight**: This plugin only provides utility file operations, it does
  not provide a full-blown file manager UI.

**Quality-of-life**
- All movement and renaming commands **update `import` statements** to the
  renamed file (if the LSP supports `workspace/willRenameFiles`).
- Automatically keep the extension when no extension is given.
- Use vim motions in the input field.

## Installation
**Requirements**
- nvim 0.10+
- A `vim.ui.input` provider such as
  [dressing.nvim](http://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) or
  [snacks.nvim](http://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) for an input UI that
  **supports vim motions** and looks much nicer.
- *For the trash command*: an OS-specific trash CLI like `trash` or `gio trash`.
  On macOS 14+, there is a `trash` cli already built-in, so there is no need to
  install anything.

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{ "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis" },

-- packer
use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis" }
```

## Configuration
The `setup` call is required for `lazy.nvim`, but otherwise optional.

```lua
-- default config
require("genghis").setup {
	-- cli name, default is `trash` on Mac and Windows, and `gio trash` on Linux
	---@type string|string[]|false
	trashCmd = setDefaultTrashCmd(),

	-- set to empty string to disable
	-- (some icons are only used for notification plugins like `snacks.nvim`)
	icons = {
		chmodx = "󰒃",
		copyFile = "󱉥",
		copyPath = "󰅍",
		duplicate = "",
		file = "󰈔",
		move = "󰪹",
		new = "󰝒",
		nextFile = "󰖽",
		prevFile = "󰖿",
		rename = "󰑕",
		trash = "󰩹",
	},

	navigation = {
		ignoreExt = { "png", "svg", "webp", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "pdf", "zip" },
	},

	successNotifications = true,
}
```

## Usage
You can access a command as lua function:

```lua
require("genghis").createNewFile()
```

Or you can use the ex command `:Genghis` with the respective sub-command:

```vim
:Genghis createNewFile
```

### File operations
- `.createNewFile`: Create a new file.
- `.duplicateFile`: Duplicate the current file.
- `.moveSelectionToNewFile`: Prompts for a new filename
  and moves the current selection to that new file. (Visual
  Line command, the selection is moved linewise.)
- `.renameFile`: Rename the current file.
- `.moveAndRenameFile`: Move and Rename the current file. Keeps the
  old name if the new path ends with `/`. Works like the Unix `mv` command.
- `.moveToFolderInCwd`: Move the current file to an existing folder in the
  current working directory.
- `.chmodx`: Makes current file executable. Equivalent to `chmod +x`.
- `.trashFile`: Move the current file to the trash. Defaults to `gio trash` on
  *Linux*, and `trash` on *macOS* or *Windows*. (The trash CLIs must usually be
  installed.)
- `.showInSystemExplorer`: Reveals the current file in the system explorer, such
  as macOS Finder. (Currently only on macOS, PRs welcome.)

The following applies to all commands above:
1. If no extension has been provided, uses the extension of the original file.
2. If the new filename includes a `/`, the new file is placed in the
   respective subdirectory, creating any non-existing intermediate folders.
3. All movement and renaming commands update `import` statements to the renamed
   file (if the LSP supports `workspace/willRenameFiles`).

### Copy operations
- `.copyFilename`: Copy the filename.
- `.copyFilepath`: Copy the absolute file path.
- `.copyFilepathWithTilde`: Copy the absolute file path, replacing the home
  directory with `~`.
- `.copyRelativePath`: Copy the relative file path.
- `.copyDirectoryPath`: Copy the absolute directory path.
- `.copyRelativeDirectoryPath`: Copy the relative directory path.
- `.copyFileItself`: Copies the file itself. This means you can paste it into
  the browser or file manager. (Currently only on macOS, PRs welcome.)

All commands use the system clipboard.

### File navigation
`.navigateToFileInFolder("next"|"prev")`: Move to the next/previous file in the
current folder of the current file, in alphabetical order.
- If `snacks.nvim` is installed, displays a cycling notification.

## Why the name "Genghis"?
A nod to [vim.eunuch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch), an older vimscript
plugin with a similar goal. As opposed to childless eunuchs, it is said that
Genghis Khan [has fathered thousands of
children](https://allthatsinteresting.com/genghis-khan-children).
