Lightweightand quick file operations without being a full-blown file manager.
For when you prefer a fuzzy finder over a file tree, but still want some
convenient file operations inside nvim.

FEATURES                                 *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--features*

**Commands** - Perform **common file operations**: moving, renaming, creating,
deleting, or duplicating files. - **Copy** the path or name of the current file
in various formats. - **Navigate** to the next or previous file in the current
folder.

**Quality-of-life** - All movement and renaming commands **update import
statements** to the renamed file (if the LSP supports
`workspace/willRenameFiles`). - Automatically keep the extension when no
extension is given. - Use vim motions in the input field.


INSTALLATION                         *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--installation*

**Requirements** - nvim 0.10+ - _For the trash command_: an OS-specific trash
CLI like `trash` or `gio trash`. (Since macOS 14+, there is a `trash` CLI
already built-in, so there is no need to install anything.) - **Recommended:**
A provider for `vim.ui.input` and `vim.ui.select` such as snacks.nvim
<http://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim>. This enables vim motions in the input
field and looks nicer.

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    { "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis" }
    
    -- packer
    use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis" }
<


CONFIGURATION                       *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--configuration*

The `.setup()` call is optional.

>lua
    -- default config
    require("genghis").setup {
        fileOperations = {
            -- automatically keep the extension when no file extension is given
            -- (everything after the first non-leading dot is treated as the extension)
            autoAddExt = true,
    
            trashCmd = function() ---@type fun(): string|string[]
                if jit.os == "OSX" then return "trash" end -- builtin since macOS 14
                if jit.os == "Windows" then return "trash" end
                if jit.os == "Linux" then return { "gio", "trash" } end
                return "trash-cli"
            end,
    
            ignoreInFolderSelection = { -- using lua pattern matching (e.g., escape `-` as `%-`)
                "/node_modules/", -- nodejs
                "/typings/", -- python
                "/doc/", -- vim help files folders
                "%.app/", -- macOS pseudo-folders
                "/%.", -- hidden folders
            },
        },
    
        navigation = {
            onlySameExtAsCurrentFile = false,
            ignoreDotfiles = true,
            ignoreExt = { "png", "svg", "webp", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "pdf", "zip" },
            ignoreFilesWithName = { ".DS_Store" },
        },
    
        successNotifications = true,
    
        icons = { -- set an icon to empty string to disable it
            chmodx = "󰒃",
            copyFile = "󱉥",
            copyPath = "󰅍",
            duplicate = "",
            file = "󰈔",
            move = "󰪹",
            new = "󰝒",
            nextFile = "󰖽",
            prevFile = "󰖿",
            rename = "󰑕",
            trash = "󰩹",
        },
    }

UI PLUGIN ~

A UI plugin for `vim.ui.input` and `vim.ui.select`, such as snacks.nvim
<http://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim>, is recommended since it enables for vim
motions in the input field. (It also looks much nicer.)

>lua
    -- minimal snacks.nvim config to use it for `vim.ui.input` and `vim.ui.select`
    require("snacks").setup({
        input = { enabled = true },
        picker = { enabled = true },
    }),
<


USAGE                                       *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--usage*

You can access a command as Lua function:

>lua
    require("genghis").createNewFile()
<

Or you can use the ex command `:Genghis` with the respective sub-command:

>vim
    :Genghis createNewFile
<


FILE OPERATIONS ~

- `createNewFile`: Create a new file in the same directory as the current file.
- `createNewFileInFolder`: Create a new file in a folder in the current working
    directory.
- `duplicateFile`: Duplicate the current file.
- `moveSelectionToNewFile`: Create a new file and move the current selection
    to it. (Visual Line command, the selection is moved linewise.)
- `renameFile`: Rename the current file.
- `moveToFolderInCwd`: Move the current file to an existing folder in the
    current working directory.
- `moveAndRenameFile`: Move and rename the current file. Keeps the
    old name if the new path ends with `/`. Works like the UNIX `mv` command.
- `chmodx`: Makes current file executable. Equivalent to `chmod +x`.
- `trashFile`: Move the current file to the trash. (Defaults to `gio trash` on
    _Linux_, and `trash` on _macOS_ or _Windows_.)
- `showInSystemExplorer`: Reveals the current file in the system explorer, such
    as macOS Finder. (Currently only on macOS, PRs welcome.)

The following applies to all commands above: 1. If no extension has been
provided, uses the extension of the original file. (Everything after the first
non-leading dot is treated as the extension; this behavior can be disabled with
the config `fileOperations.autoAddExt = false`.) 2. If the new filename
includes a `/`, the new file is placed in the respective subdirectory, creating
any non-existing intermediate folders. 3. All movement and renaming commands
update `import` statements, if the LSP supports `workspace/willRenameFiles`.


COPY OPERATIONS ~

- `copyFilename`: Copy the filename.
- `copyFilepath`: Copy the absolute filepath.
- `copyFilepathWithTilde`: Copy the absolute filepath, replacing the home
    directory with `~`.
- `copyRelativePath`: Copy the relative filepath.
- `copyDirectoryPath`: Copy the absolute directory path.
- `copyRelativeDirectoryPath`: Copy the relative directory path.
- `copyFileItself`: Copies the file itself. This means you can paste it into
    the browser or file manager. (Currently only on macOS, PRs welcome.)

All commands use the system clipboard.


FILE NAVIGATION ~

`require("genghis").navigateToFileInFolder("next"|"prev")`: Move to the
next/previous file in the current folder of the current file, in alphabetical
order.

If `snacks.nvim` is installed, displays a cycling notification.


WHY THE NAME “GENGHIS”?*nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--why-the-name-“genghis”?*

A nod to vim.eunuch <https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch>, an older vimscript
plugin with a similar goal. As opposed to childless eunuchs, it is said that
Genghis Khan has fathered thousands of children
<https://allthatsinteresting.com/genghis-khan-children>.
