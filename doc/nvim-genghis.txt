Lightweightand quick file operations without being a full-blown file manager.
For when you prefer a fuzzy finder over a file tree, but still want some
convenient file operations inside nvim.

FEATURES                                 *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--features*

**Commands** - Perform **common file operations**moving, renaming, creating,
deleting, or duplicating files. - **Copy** the path or name of the current file
in various formats. - **Navigate** to the next or previous file in the current
folder. - **Lightweight**This plugin only provides utility file operations, it
does not provide a full-blown file manager UI.

**Quality-of-life** - All movement and renaming commands **update import
statements** to the renamed file (if the LSP supports
`workspace/willRenameFiles`). - Automatically keep the extension when no
extension is given. - Use vim motions in the input field.


INSTALLATION                         *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--installation*

**Requirements** - nvim 0.10+ - A `vim.ui.input` provider such as dressing.nvim
<http://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim> or snacks.nvim
<http://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim> for an input UI that **supports vim
motions** and looks much nicer. - _For the trash command_an OS-specific trash
CLI like `trash` or `gio trash`. On macOS 14+, there is a `trash` cli already
built-in, so there is no need to install anything.

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    { "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis" },
    
    -- packer
    use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-genghis" }
<


CONFIGURATION                       *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--configuration*

The `setup` call is required for `lazy.nvim`, but otherwise optional.

>lua
    -- default config
    require("genghis").setup {
        ---@type fun(): string|string[]
        trashCmd = function()
            if jit.os == "OSX" then return "trash" end -- builtin since macOS 14
            if jit.os == "Windows" then return "trash" end
            if jit.os == "Linux" then return { "gio", "trash" } end
            return "trash-cli"
        end,
    
        navigation = {
            onlySameExtAsCurrentFile = false,
            ignoreDotfiles = true,
            ignoreExt = { "png", "svg", "webp", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "pdf", "zip", "DS_Store" },
        },
    
        successNotifications = true,
    
        icons = { -- set to empty string to disable
            chmodx = "󰒃",
            copyFile = "󱉥",
            copyPath = "󰅍",
            duplicate = "",
            file = "󰈔",
            move = "󰪹",
            new = "󰝒",
            nextFile = "󰖽",
            prevFile = "󰖿",
            rename = "󰑕",
            trash = "󰩹",
        },
    }

USAGE                                       *nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--usage*

You can access a command as lua function:

>lua
    require("genghis").createNewFile()
<

Or you can use the ex command `:Genghis` with the respective sub-command:

>vim
    :Genghis createNewFile
<


FILE OPERATIONS ~

- `createNewFile`Create a new file.
- `duplicateFile`Duplicate the current file.
- `moveSelectionToNewFile`Prompts for a new filename
    and moves the current selection to that new file. (Visual
    Line command, the selection is moved linewise.)
- `renameFile`Rename the current file.
- `moveAndRenameFile`Move and Rename the current file. Keeps the
    old name if the new path ends with `/`. Works like the Unix `mv` command.
- `moveToFolderInCwd`Move the current file to an existing folder in the
    current working directory.
- `chmodx`Makes current file executable. Equivalent to `chmod +x`.
- `trashFile`Move the current file to the trash. Defaults to `gio trash` on
    _Linux_, and `trash` on _macOS_ or _Windows_. (The trash CLIs must usually be
    installed.)
- `showInSystemExplorer`Reveals the current file in the system explorer, such
    as macOS Finder. (Currently only on macOS, PRs welcome.)

The following applies to all commands above: 1. If no extension has been
provided, uses the extension of the original file. 2. If the new filename
includes a `/`, the new file is placed in the respective subdirectory, creating
any non-existing intermediate folders. 3. All movement and renaming commands
update `import` statements to the renamed file (if the LSP supports
`workspace/willRenameFiles`).


COPY OPERATIONS ~

- `copyFilename`Copy the filename.
- `copyFilepath`Copy the absolute file path.
- `copyFilepathWithTilde`Copy the absolute file path, replacing the home
    directory with `~`.
- `copyRelativePath`Copy the relative file path.
- `copyDirectoryPath`Copy the absolute directory path.
- `copyRelativeDirectoryPath`Copy the relative directory path.
- `copyFileItself`Copies the file itself. This means you can paste it into
    the browser or file manager. (Currently only on macOS, PRs welcome.)

All commands use the system clipboard.


FILE NAVIGATION ~

`.navigateToFileInFolder("next"|"prev")`Move to the next/previous file in the
current folder of the current file, in alphabetical order. - If `snacks.nvim`
is installed, displays a cycling notification.


WHY THE NAME “GENGHIS”?*nvim-genghis-nvim-genghis--why-the-name-“genghis”?*

A nod to vim.eunuch <https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch>, an older vimscript
plugin with a similar goal. As opposed to childless eunuchs, it is said that
Genghis Khan has fathered thousands of children
<https://allthatsinteresting.com/genghis-khan-children>.
